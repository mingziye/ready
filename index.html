			<h1>Number of People DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL in 2011 & 2016</h1><br>
			<p3 class = "wow fadeInDown">Due to more Government welfare, which provide<br>
				more ways to make living, more people give up<br>
				to accept education but go into the society trying<br>
				to earn money. In the maps which the color indicates<br>
				total population in each region while the height <br>
				demonstrates the population who didn't go to school.<br>
				It is clear to see more people didn't go to <br>
				school in 2016 comparing to that of 2011. One more <br>
				reason is because people live in southern of latte line <br>
				are not required very high education as this area is the main <br>
				working space for blue collar</p3>
